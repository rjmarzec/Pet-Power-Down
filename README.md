# Pet Power Down
 A game about finding pets when the power goes out, designed with the visually impaired in mind.

This game was put together collaboratively by Blake Hall, Robert Marzec, Agatha Ta-Goetz, and Sabrina Xiao for the University of Michigan's "Gaming for the Greater Good" course in the Fall of 2019.

Pet Power Down (PPD) has you assume the role of various pet owners as they try to locate their pet(s) after their lights have gone out, only being able to the sounds around them to judge how to progress.

Rooted in audio being the way to play the game, PPD offers and experience that is enjoyable and playable at the same level for people with any level of visual impairment, ranging from none at all to complete blindness.
